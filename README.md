Theft Risk Classifier

Project Overview:

This project predicts the theft risk of retail products based on features such as price, popularity, security level, and category. It uses a synthetic dataset and machine learning classification to identify products at higher risk of theft, providing actionable insights for retailers to improve security and reduce losses.

The project includes data analysis, model training, and a Streamlit web application for interactive theft risk prediction.

Features:

- Synthetic data simulation of retail products and theft occurrences.
- Exploratory data analysis with visualizations of relationships and feature importance.
- Training and evaluation of machine learning models including Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and XGBoost.
- Interactive Streamlit app for real-time theft risk prediction based on user input.
- Alignment of input features with the trained model for consistent predictions.

Technologies Used:

- Python 3.x
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- XGBoost
- SHAP (for model interpretability)
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Streamlit
